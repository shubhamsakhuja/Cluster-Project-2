Quarterly crime statistics produced by the CSA are based on a rolling 12 month set of statistics that collate four quarters of data. As such, three quarters from the previous reference period are carried forward into the next 12 month period, with the addition of the most recent quarter. This means that changes that may occur within one quarter will be included in four different crime statistics releases. Data was extracted from the Victoria Police Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP) database on 18 October 2016. \n<br/>\nThe dataset represents all offences recorded in the Victoria Police Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP) database between October 2011 and September 2016, where Victoria Police have recorded a crime prohibited by criminal law.
